# Pi failure signaling

For a failure passed to different consumers, read the
[worked example](typescript-failure-examples.md#preserve-a-conflict-until-its-consumer-renders-it).

## Failed tool results carry text only (Required)

Throw from `execute` to fail, and render any data the model needs into the message in a fixed form,
such as `Current revision: 12.` Pi's execution catch calls `createErrorToolResult(message)` and sets
`isError: true`; the helper creates text content with `details: {}`. A thrown error's custom fields
do not reach the model through this path.
[Execution catch](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/v0.85.1/packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts#L668-L674),
[error result](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/v0.85.1/packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts#L724-L729).
Apply the
[content and details rule](pi-tools.md#separate-model-output-from-structured-state-required).

## Report cancellation and unsupported modes as outcomes, not failures (Required)

Keep an extension's `cancelled` and `unsupported-mode` outcomes distinct from errors, and check the
execute signal or `ctx.signal` before classifying a caught error. Pi's pre-execution abort checks
emit `Operation aborted` with failure status from the signal; they do not inspect a thrown kind. The
execution catch uses the thrown message, so do not assume every abort is rewritten to that text.
[Signal check](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/v0.85.1/packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts#L617-L622),
[execution catch](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/v0.85.1/packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts#L668-L674).
Apply the
[lifecycle cancellation rule](pi-lifecycle.md#use-cancellation-from-the-operations-context-required)
and [UI dismissal rule](pi-ui-and-rpc.md#resolve-the-ui-independently-of-agent-completion-required);
use the [mode outcome rule](pi-ui-and-rpc.md#check-the-capability-the-interaction-requires-required)
when the required UI is unavailable.

## Translate at each Pi surface (Default)

At a tool boundary, render a recognized failure's data and recovery action into the thrown message
and retain the original failure as its cause. Rethrow unexpected errors unchanged when the adapter
accepts them; if it requires a wrapper for a non-Error value, retain that value as the cause and add
no speculative advice. In a command handler, notify with actions the user can perform. In a TUI,
show the failed action and only the recovery guidance needed beside its controls. For programmatic
consumers, preserve the typed failure instead of returning tool-oriented text. For example, render a
conflict's revision and reload instruction for the model, but expose both revisions to a callback
consumer. Give model-facing wording one owner under the
[tool wording rule](pi-tools.md#make-the-tool-contract-sufficient-for-invocation-default), and
derive remediation from the
[error contract](typescript-error-contracts.md#give-remediation-text-one-owner-at-the-boundary-default).
[Command notifications](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/v0.85.1/packages/coding-agent/docs/extensions.md#piregistercommandname-options).

## Type the callbacks you hand to other extensions (Required)

Give a presenter or hook a versioned contract with documented kinds and reactions under the
[callback error rule](typescript-error-contracts.md#document-the-kinds-a-contract-may-throw-required).
Use validated string discriminants across extension boundaries. Pi creates a loader per extension
with `moduleCache: false`; infer that extension-local class copies need not share identity, even
when both extensions import the same class name. A documented `conflict` kind remains recognizable
across those copies.
[Extension loading](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/v0.85.1/packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/loader.ts#L461-L479).

## Test failure status and cancellation through the adapter (Default)

Assert `isError` through the tool adapter, a cancelled extension outcome on abort, and preserved
unexpected errors without added remediation. Exercise both rejected promises and returned failure
outcomes when the adapter accepts both. Verify that each supported surface renders only its
audience's instructions, exactly once, and that programmatic consumers retain structured data and
causes. Keep the extension outcome assertion separate from Pi's aborted-tool failure status; neither
a rendered message nor a direct domain call establishes the adapter's behavior. Follow the
[adapter testing rule](pi-testing.md#test-tool-and-mode-contracts-at-the-adapter-boundary-required)
and [kind assertions](typescript-error-contracts.md#assert-kinds-not-message-text-default).
